Data Quality & Limitations: Discuss any identified data quality issues (e.g., missing values, inconsistencies) and their potential impact on the analysis.

Analytical Tools & Techniques: Mention the tools used (e.g., SQL, Python/R, Tableau/Power BI) and general analytical approaches (e.g., descriptive statistics, trend analysis, correlation).

## IV. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Analysis
In this section, I will present the performance against critical logistics KPIs.

### A. On-Time Delivery (OTD) Performance:

Overall OTD Rate (Actual vs. Expected Delivery Date).

Trend analysis of OTD over time.

OTD breakdown by:

Shipping Mode (Surface vs. Air)

Service Type (e.g., Express, Standard)

Geographical Region (Origin/Destination City/State/Zone)

Weight/Volume Category

### B. Transit Time Analysis:

Average End-to-End Transit Time.

Distribution of transit times (min, max, median, quartiles).

Transit time variations by:

Route/Lane (Origin-Destination pairs)

Shipping Mode

Distance Bins

### C. Delivery Success & Failure Rates:

Overall Delivery Success Rate.

Breakdown of Delivery Failures:

Return to Origin (RTO) Rate.

Lost Shipment Rate.

Damaged Shipment Rate.

Analysis of reasons for RTO, Loss, and Damage.

### D. Cost Efficiency:

Average Cost Per Shipment.

Cost Per Unit Weight/Volume.

Cost analysis by:

Shipping Mode.

Geographical Lane.

Service Type.

Correlation between cost and transit time/OTD.

### E. First Attempt Delivery Rate (FADR):

Overall FADR.

Factors influencing FADR (e.g., delivery time window, recipient availability).

## V. Deep Dive Analysis
### A. Geographical Performance Hotspots:

Identification of top-performing and underperforming cities/states/zones in terms of OTD, transit time, and success rates.

Mapping of performance metrics to visualize geographical patterns.

### B. Service Level & Product Mix Performance:

Detailed comparison of performance across different service types offered by Delhivery.
